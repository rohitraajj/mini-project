        <p>The All India War Memorial, popularly known as the India Gate, is located along the Rajpath in New Delhi. The imposing structure of India Gate is an awe-inspiring sight and is often compared to the Arch de Triomphe in France, the Gateway of India in Mumbai and the Arch of Constantine in Rome. This 42-meter tall historical structure was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of the largest war memorials in the country. India Gate is also famous for hosting the Republic Day Parade every year.</p>

        <p>Dedicated to 82,000 Indian and British soldiers who died during the First World War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War, this monument has the names of 13,300 servicemen inscribed on its surface. The premises of India Gate also houses the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which is a kindled structure right underneath the archway. Owing to its rich historical background and astonishing architecture, India Gate has become one of the most popular picnic spots in the city.</p>
        
        <h3>Design of India Gate </h3>

        <p>Sir Edwin Lutyens, one of the finest war memorial designers, drafted the design for the All India War memorial in New Delhi. Perched on the centre of a hexagonal complex with a diameter of 625 metres, India Gate covers a total area of 3,60,000 metres square. It is 42 metres tall and has a width of 9.1 metres. It stands on a low base red stone from Bharatpur and then rises in stages. There is a shallow dome-shaped bowl on the top of the India Gate which is rarely filled with burning oil on special occasions. The India Gate is a secular memorial, leaving aside religious and cultural sentiments. Lutyen used the universal architectural style free of religious ornamentation. It has also been called as the remake of Arch de Triomphe since it resembles the structure. Also, right behind the spectacular India Gate, around 150 metres away, is a canopy-like structure which was also built by Edwin Lutyens. It had a statue of Lord George V. but later it was removed.</p>
