        <h1>Jallianwala Bagh</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Located near the famous Golden Temple of Amritsar, Jallianwala Bagh is a public garden that also houses a memorial to commemorate the massacre of peaceful celebrators by the British forces. Spread over 6.5 acres of land, Jallianwala Bagh is associated with one of the saddest days in Indian History when thousands of innocent people were killed on the orders of General Dyer as they gathered for a peaceful celebration of Baisakhi. The place has now been turned into a beautiful park and is managed by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust.</p>

        <p>There is a memorial tablet at the entrance which serves as a record of history. The tragic incident left a deep scar on the country, and a memorial was constructed post the independence for the innocents who lost their lives in this devastating incident. Established by the government of India in 1951, the massacre memorial was inaugurated by Dr Rajendra Prasad on 13th April 1961.</p> 

        <p>A number of structures are present inside the premises which resound of the atrocities that occurred here. These include a wall which still bears the marks of the bullets that were hurled blindly at the civilians and a well in which many people jumped to save themselves from the onslaught of the bullets. It is estimated that over a 1000 Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs lost their lives in this brutal assault. a narrow alley of immense historical importance passes through here. An air of eerie calm still lingers over the Jallianwala Bagh and gives one a feeling of indescribable sadness and peace.</p>

        <h3>Jallianwala Bagh Massacre </h3>
        <p>In April of 1919, Brigadier General R.E.H Dyer arrived in Amritsar and occupied the city under his rule as the civil administration under Miles Irving had come to a halt. Suspecting a revolt, General Dyer announced a ban on meetings and conventions by the people, but this information was not widely propagated.</p>

        <p>On the 13th of April, 1919 a peaceful gathering of people convened in the Jallianwala Bagh to celebrate the festival of Baisakhi. Upon getting the first information about the assembly, General Dyer marched towards the Bagh with a battalion of ninety Sikh, Gurkha, Baluchi, Rajput troops from 2-9th Gurkhas, the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles. Dyer and the troops ascended a raised platform in the garden and announced indiscriminate and unprovoked firing on thousands of nonviolent and unarmed Indians.</p>

        <p>Dyer continued firing until the ammunition was exhausted, killing innocent and unarmed men, women and children. Officially, the British Indian sources identified 379 people dead in the incident with 1,200 wounded. However, the number of casualties estimated by the Indian National Congress was a staggering 1,500 with 1,000 people succumbing to the bullet wounds.</p>

        <h3>Jallianwala Bagh Wall and Well </h3>
        <p>The wounds that were hurled at Jallianwala Bagh by the British find a tangible existence at two very particular structures in the garden. These two structures are solemn reminders of our freedom struggle and the sacrifices made by our predecessors to build an independent India.</p>

        <p>The first is the wall towards the end of the park, which is still riddled with the marks of up to 36 bullets that were fired at the crowds. The second is a well, situated near the entrance of the park was where many people attending the meeting had jumped in order to dodge the bullets. After the firing had subsided, hundreds of dead bodies were retracted from the well.</p>
